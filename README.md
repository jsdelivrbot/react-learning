# React Learning Exercises

## Modern React with Redux
#### udemy-react-redux

This course (https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) is a basic primer to ReactJS and
teaches through multiple small projects.

The contents of this repo are my code created during the course, but mostly just
clones of the instructor Stephen Grider's starters: https://github.com/StephenGrider.

I really enjoyed the working examples that you are able to produce in this course
and the instructor tries to teach some pretty good practices as well. The pacing can
be a bit slow at times though.
